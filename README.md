# coding-quiz
A timed coding quiz game based on javascript built to infinitely scale around added answers.

#Quiz Overview

Project is currently incomplete, as leaderboard has not been implemented, and the user isn't prompted to play again -- however,
the way I structured the logic makes the number of questions infinitely scaleable and dynamically generates answer/question order, so every element is truly random.

While this was a more time consuming and challenging way to address the project, I thought it was the best way to build my ability to produce robust and powerful code.
